## GENERAL OVERVIEW
### (a page)

- Describe **what your project is about**.

Describe what kind of experience you intend to offer the audience, what drives you to make it, and what you think is interesting about it. What is the problem you are addressing? What is the solution you are offering? This is the part of the document where you must capture the attention of your reader, so try to be as interesting and concise as possible.

- Describe **why this project is relevant to its medium.**

What is it about AR that will make it different than on another medium? This is where you show the reader that you not only have a great idea, but that you also understand the technical aspects of the medium you're working in â€”whether you have a clear idea or whether you just want to test out an idea. Make sure you also mention why this is important as a cultural experience.

- Describe **the learning experience that you want to suggest** in your audience.

Why would anyone want to experience your particular project, and what would you like them to get out of it? Do they learn/reflect/play/challenge? Include how you will achieve that goal through *interactions* and *content*.

- Are there any **unusual aspects?**

Something that other projects in the same field don't have to take care of, but that you're experimenting with for the first time?  This part is meant to show that you are not afraid to push boundaries of what exists, but that you are also aware of what you are doing.

- Have similar projects **already been done?**

Show that you've done your research and you're not reinventing the wheel. What other projects exist, either within a museum setting or not? How successful were they? How do you build on their achievements and/or shortcomings? What do you do similarly and what do you do differently?

## DESIGN OVERVIEW
#### (one pages)

- Describe **the context** of your project.

What aspect of the world are you representing (the buidling around the audience, a country on the other side of the world? life as it happened in the same place 400 years ago, etc.)? What are the facts (historical, geographical, economical) that you are incorporating in your project? What are the objects that represent some of those facts? What are the different perspectives one could have on those facts? Are you trying to accomodate all of them, or are you taking a stance? Why?

- Describe **the core interaction(s)** of your project.

Why does the audience want to do that interaction? Should they be walking, swiping, scanning, shaking, listening, speaking? What are they interacting with? Why is it meaningful? What is the place of the device in the learning experience? Is it central, or is it peripheral? Does that place change over time?

- Describe **the navigation flow** of your project.

How does the audience start your application? How does it end? What are the different screens they see and how do those screens connect between each other?

- Describe **the interface** of your project.

How does the audience member interact with your project? How does the interface of your project allows her to understand what is going on and how to manipulate the state of the world? You should include sketches/wireframes of what the different interface elements should look like (e.g. potential titles, buttons, sliders, knobs, text inputs, etc), either hand-drawn and scanned, or using Adobe XD (exporting them as PNG or PDF, which you would submit separately from this document).

- Describe **the media assets** of your project.

What are the assets that you are going to need? Photos, drawings, renderings, sound recordings, music recordings? Where do you plan on getting them? What are their technical specifications (resolution, aspect ratio, size, format, etc.)?

## EXPERIENCE OVERVIEW
#### (half page)

- Describe **the overall experience** of the audience member. How do they join? Where do they start? What would they typically do? How would they conclude their experience? Emphasize the important moments and the transition moments.

- Describe **a specific moment**. Try to be as precise and thorough as possible. Where does the audience member look? How do they move? What is going on in their head? What is a practical, perhaps almost lyrical depiction of the scene? How does the system look like at that moment? How does it evolve? This should be able to show the reader that you care about details and that you are not only thing in broad, abstract terms.

## CONCLUSION
#### (half page)

- Remind the reader why your project is worth funding/presenting/experiencing.
