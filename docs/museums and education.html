<p><strong>how</strong> do we learn?</p>
<ul>
<li>guides / museum tours</li>
<li>descriptions / wall texts</li>
<li>interactive installations (turning abstract theories &gt; tangible knowledge)</li>
<li>group activities (workshops)</li>
<li>group activities (conferences/panels)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>what</strong> do we learn?</p>
<ul>
<li>artists, (fine-)art, collections</li>
<li>history</li>
<li>anything: natural history, scientific, engineering</li>
<li>nothing: &quot;this says this&quot;, but very limited</li>
</ul>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>how do we learn: for instance, panels of information, ask questions (interaction), hands-on projects, learn from somebody else in the same tour with you (social context of a museum), anybody or expert, novice. digital spaces through comments/forums.</p>
<p>what do we learn? new facts (different perceptions) / new behaviour, reflect on our own position in society</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">mediation and social distinctions</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>the modern museum is stretched between an </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>aesthetic</strong> (learning about perspective in italy, or about enluminure, fauvism, impressionism)</li>
<li><strong>ethical</strong> (war museums, holocaust memorials)</li>
<li>and <strong>social</strong> (futurium: living together in the future, museums for engineering, museum for german history, DDR museum, national museum of X ) role.</li>
</ul>
<p>so the question is: <em>how can someone develop knowledge just by looking/reading at something?</em></p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Mediation means meeting someone in the middle, of having to concile (or re-concile!) two or more different parties. What is reconciled here is the truth held  by museums, as the cultural heritage which needs to be transmitted to the public in order to reinforce the sense of unity and communal belonging of this public. Additionally, mediation and education are rooted in the enlightenment spirit of learning and developing knowledge so that, in the end, they transmit their worldview to the audience.</p>
<p>The questions here are those of understanding and seeing, objectivity and subjectivity, externalising and internalising: what are some ways of transmitting, and facilitating the development of ideas, concepts and knowledge.</p>
<p>But if mediation—and its counterpart, interpretation—imply closing the gap on the distance between the artwork and the public, wouldn&#39;t be interesting to know why that gap is here in the first place?</p>
<p>(in needs to be in context/background knowledge (collections, texts))</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">hermeneutics</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>the methodology of interpreting <em>sacred</em> texts reinforces the sacredness of these texts.</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Museums have, for a long time, never questioned how to proceed with education. It has always been top-down, explanatory, or even ommitted. Mediation has indeed been activated once the audience is in the museum, and not so much <em>before</em> such audiences would come to the museum: the assumption here is that everyone in the museum comes for the same reasons, wants to learn the same thing.</p>
<p>The approach is therefore self-contained and self-referential: it only exists within the world of the museum, since the museum represents the world, and it explains the artworks only in relationship to the artworks themselves. Art for art&#39;s sake is the manifestation of the luxury/privilege.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">taste as distinction</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>the sacredness implies some sort of hierarchy</p>
<p>&quot;<em>museums exists so that people who go to museums can distinguish themselves from those who do not go</em>&quot; - pierre bourdieu</p>
<p>habitus</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><ul>
<li>social capital</li>
<li>economic capital</li>
<li><strong>cultural capital</strong></li>
<li>symbolic capital</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Bourdieu has a very strict sense of culture: it is culture as an economic product, a market in which value is produced, exchanged and kept in order to maintain relationships of power. He places the museum in this dynamic as a symbolic way to separate between those who know and those who don&#39;t know; it also makes the distinction between those who need to learn, and those who don&#39;t need to learn (because they come from distinctive social classes).</p>
<p>Taste is socially constructed, but it still possibly individually defined—by experiencing more things, being more exposed, learning/reading about it at the same time, paying attention and <strong>motivations</strong>.</p>
<p>High-art is not a necessity, it is rather the &quot;pure&quot; gaze, and is <strong>self-referential</strong>.</p>
<p>The distinction also happens in the process of coding, and decoding, and &quot;knowing what something means&quot;</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">a need for new types of education</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>didactic learning implies a reinforcing of implicit power dynamics and capital inequalities.</p>
<p>are there other forms of learning which address these issues?</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>take 5 minutes and think through:</p>
<p>what was a memorable learning experience in your life (in/outside school)? what did you learn? how did you learn it?</p>
<p>victor: outside of school, telling stories around engravings of historical figures</p>
<p>ruyang: outside of school, learning to bike, ride the bike home without knowing how to</p>
<p>omar: watching animes, and understanding japanese, pure exposition</p>
<p>elizabeth: traveling, encountered a different culture</p>
<p>shahad: new equipment, picked up on it through the need</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>The process of explaining to someone implies the situation in which someone knows (has power) and in which someone doesn&#39;t know (doesn&#39;t have power), and is therefore essentially unequal.</p>
<p>This type of education perpetuates distinctions between the elite and the masses, and as such has strong political undertones. If museums are going to follow on their process of access to all, they must also change the way they view education.</p>

<p>First developed by John Dewey, political philosopher and educator, constructivism challenges the <em>passive learner</em> approach and offers activities to the learner so that they can construct knowledge by themselves. </p>
<p>Discovery learning, an offshoot, still involves teacher supervision, assessment/feedback and example solutions, and also requires <strong>pre-exisiting knowledge</strong>. In order to build from pre-existing knowledge, it therefore becomes important to know the background of your visitors/students/participants.</p>
