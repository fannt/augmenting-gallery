the work of art in the age of mechanical reproduction</div><div class="prep note" concept="9">&quot;aura&quot;</div></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="9">The evolution of the ability to reproduce works of art resulted in the loss of its aesthetic value through its unique claim to being an authentic original. Benjamin terms this value the work of art’s “aura” and the aura developed great ritualistic meaning over time. With reproduction made easier, cheaper and faster, this aura was diminished and along with it ritualistic value was replaced by exhibition value: when there’s more than duplicate, a greater number of can enjoy it. Art became product.</div><div class="prep writeup" concept="9">Benjamin claims that in times past the role of art has been to provide a magical foundation for the cult. Here the artwork’s use value was located in its central position within ritual and religious tradition. So, in a sense, his reading is a positive one: we are duplicating the art work in order to spread it to the masses and, in the process, taking down the unique aspect of the artwork, its singularity —and therefore worth and elitism.</div><div class="prep writeup" concept="9">&quot;Even the most perfect reproduction of a work of art is lacking in one element: Its presence in time and space, its unique existence at the place where it happens to be.&quot; — This place is the called the cultural context; by changing the cultural context, one changes the meaning of the work.</div></div></div><hr><div class="concept-group"><h3 class="concept-name">isolated technologies</h3><div class="prep-group"><div class="prep note" concept="10">VR can help grasp the scale and existence of what is no longer (either exhibited or existing)</div><div class="prep note" concept="10"><a href="https://www.newpalmyra.org/models/temple-of-bel/">new palmyra project</a></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="10">VR and AR can exist both within a museum, and outside a museum. It's then about context: because the layout of information on the Web is more prone to easy navigation, then it makes sense to have it available outside the physical bounds of the museum. However, this design language is not yet fully formed within the VR and AR application world, and therefore it's harder to provide the person interacting with a piece with a meaningful access to context. For now, it makes more sense to have them in a museum.</div></div></div><hr><div class="concept-group"><h3 class="concept-name">a note on fetishism</h3><div class="prep-group"><div class="prep note" concept="11">tech fetishism is focusing only on the form, to the detriment of the content.</div><div class="prep note" concept="11">file formats have pros and cons:</div><div class="prep note" concept="11"><img src="assets/standards.png"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"></div></div><hr><div class="concept-group"><h3 class="concept-name">spatial understanding</h3><div class="prep-group"><div class="prep note" concept="12">important, but only worth it if you can touch and manipulate those objects</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="12">AR (and VR) can simply show things that are not there: either they're in the museum's collection or they've been destroyed.</div></div></div><hr><div class="concept-group"><h3 class="concept-name">the museum of the future</h3><div class="prep-group"><div class="prep note" concept="13">&quot;A virtual museum has to define its target community/ies, its aims, its content and how this will be structured and delivered.&quot; -sylaiou</div><div class="prep note" concept="13">who is your audience? what would be their ideal virtual museum?</div><div class="prep note" concept="13">how does access to more information contribute to it?</div><div class="prep note" concept="13">how does access to more personalized information contribute to it?</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="13">These are the questions that you should keep in mind as you work your way through your design.
