</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>&quot;a museum is a non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society and its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes of education, study and enjoyment&quot;</p>
<p>PRC -&gt; preserve, research, communicate</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/amnh.jpg" alt="amnh.jpg"></div></div><div class="note-group"><div class="prep note" concept="1">types of museum:
- historical museums (educate the people -&gt; switch to constructivism)
- universal museums (chronological/global perspective)
- cultural/thematical museums (document space/time/practices)
- art museums (specifically on visual arts)
- natural history museums</div></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Museums are spaces for preservation, study and the spread of culture. There are different kinds of museums (natural history, national, fine arts, intangible practices, etc.) which deliver a certain kind of message. Essentially, museums are about figuring things out about the world we live in, and this figuring out happens through the careful examination of the past.</p>
<p>The above image is a diorama from the American Natural History Museum in NYC, depicting an encounter between settlers and local populations, and therefore represents a certain version of history, while attempting to be as &quot;natural&quot; as possible.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">the dawn</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>the modern museum appeared around the 18th century in Europe as an endeavour to <em>publicize</em> knowledge.</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/Louvre1615.jpg" alt="Louvre1615.jpg"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>However, museums have existed since about 500 BCE, date at which the oldest museum, founded by a babylonian princess, has been unearthed.</p>
<p>It is around the 15th century that private collections started to be organized and opened up to wealthy publics; this is concurrent to the development of western Renaissance thought, with a renewed interest for scientific inquiry. Thus, museums stand at the crossroads between knowledge and power (which aren&#39;t very remote from each other)—truth-telling as education and control.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">the object</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>what is the relationship between objects and museums?</p>
<p>-&gt; what do museums do to objects?</p>
<p>-&gt; what do objects do to museums?</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>the object is something already has a distance between us and it, has a meaning we can think about more easily.</p>
<p>museums both <em>increase and decrease</em> that distance: they put the objects behind glass but provide explanations for what they represent.</p>
<p>objects, in return, influence the mission of the museum, by having different facets of their stories highlighted at different moments.</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>It is not just sufficient to collect objects, the museum transforms them through interpretation and distance, turning them into <em>semiophores</em>, carriers of significance, and that significance can vary based on whether the object is &#39;authentic&#39; or a &#39;substitute&#39;.</p>
<p>This distance sometimes goes as far as the <em>Wunderkammer</em> in Germany and the <em>Exposition Coloniale</em> in France, where non-western, colonized bodies were displayed as objects of curiosities.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">to collect and to exhibit</h3><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>what makes an exhibition different in a museum than in another space?</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="1"><p>the collection and exhibition of objects is always to <strong>represent the absent facts</strong>, in relationship with the space that they are in. the museum&#39;s attempt is to be <em>objective</em>.</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="1"><p>Because a collection (and its result, the exhibition) should be at the source of scientific programs, the term scientific immediately asks &quot;what is the research question?&quot;. What is being asked, and what kind of answer is being offered?</p>
<p>This is even more salient when it comes to <em>intangible heritage</em>. The Spy Museum in Berlin is a good example of exhibiting not just objects, but the atmosphere of information warfare during the Cold war, by involving visitors in the very practices that spies used to engage in a couple of decades ago.</p>

<ul>
<li>how artworks allow us to <em>understand</em> (<a target='_blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Languages_of_Art">book</a>)</li>
<li>how artworks creates <em>new worlds</em> (<a target='_blank' href="http://www.cs.joensuu.fi/~whamalai/skc/goodman.html">book</a>)</li>
</ul>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>Goodman has thought and written a lot about how a work of art actually <em>works</em>. What makes it <em>effective</em>? Some of the answers he came up with are along a threefold line:</p>
<ul>
<li>an artwork depends not just on what it is, but on how it is implemented (where, when and how it is shown/seen)</li>
<li>an artwork is a system of symbols which allow for the understanding of complex themes and concepts</li>
<li>and artwork is a representation of a possible world</li>
</ul>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">the purpose</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>why do we (still) need museums?</p>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>Goodman&#39;s issue with museums is that works of art <em>do not always work</em>. Visitors come see the objects but do not particularly know <em>how to see</em>.</p>
<p>So he doesn&#39;t quite care about the question of &quot;why do museums exist?&quot;, because he&#39;s talking about fine arts museums (different from historical museums): museums are (his) response to the question &quot;why are we alive? we&#39;re alive to enjoy nice things.&quot;.</p>
<p>The following question he asks is &quot;how do we make sure everyone is enjoying nice things to the best of their ability?&quot;</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">the means</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>how does one educate? how to make someone appropriate some knowledge?</p>
<ul>
<li>through presentation (the work, and just the work)</li>
<li>through mediation (the explanation of the work)</li>
<li>through reproduction (through the copies)</li>
</ul>
</div></div><div class="note-group"><div class="prep note" concept="2">- intransitivity
- autotelic
- art for art's sake</div></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>The first approach might sound like the most straightforward, but is actually a deception: no one ever appreciates anything on their own, their is always a context (as stated by Hainard: &quot;<em>The object is not the truth of anything. Firstly polyfunctional, then polysemic, it takes on meaning only when placed in context.</em>&quot;).</p>
<p>The next step is therefore to introduce mediation, which then propels the artwork into interpretation-space, and that interpretation space is the first step towards the political, and possibly instrumentalized discourse around objects.</p>
<p>Finally, reproduction and comparison are the means he offers in terms of allowing for a gaze, a sight to be developed by the audience: taking the work out of the museum context, making it one&#39;s own, and then comparing it to other works, whether originals or copies.</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">the results</h3><div class="prep" concept="2"><p>how do we measure &#39;becoming more cultured&#39;?</p>
<ul>
<li>through the positive feedback loop of doing things</li>
<li>through <a target='_blank' href="https://www.artscouncil.org.uk/publication/understanding-value-and-impacts-cultural-experiences">visitor studies</a></li>
</ul>
</div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="2"><p>While even just showing that you care about something will make people care as well, a different approach to this measurement has led to the development of the field of visitor studies. The research focus of visitor studies is to develop a data-driven understanding of <em>how</em> visitors engage with the museum/exhibition/object/message and <em>what</em> is the outcomes of this engagement (positive/negative/neutral/etc.)</p>
<p>Some of the desired outcomes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>well-being/fulfillment/catharsis</li>
<li>growth/expanded worldview</li>
<li>self-expression</li>
</ul>
<p>And these outcomes can be measured:</p>
<ul>
<li>immediately (concurrent impacts)</li>
<li>in the mid-term (experienced impacts)</li>
<li>in the long-term (extended impacts)</li>
</ul>

<li>culture</li>

<p>spaces could allow for anything to happen, whereas a place is where something has already happened, and will likely happen again.</p>
<p>are museums spaces or places?</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="3"><p>museums are spaces which aim at becoming everyone&#39;s place, a <em>public sphere</em>.</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="3"><img src="augmenting-the-gallery_assets/The_Structural_Transformation_of_the_Public_Sphere_(German_edition).jpg" alt="The_Structural_Transformation_of_the_Public_Sphere_(German_edition).jpg"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="3"><p>space as potential, open to all; place as history, charged with specific meaning, manifested through <em>action</em>. place-making happens through <em>active participation</em>. how does technology affect this sense of place? do you need to be somewhere physical to <em>belong</em>? with <em>shared, collective identity and culture</em></p>
<p>tension between the museum as place-based, object-backed, and the visitor looking for <em>process</em>, <em>experiences</em>. and experiences can be taken away by the visitor. this is also due to the emergence of the constructivist notion of learning.</p>
<p>the public sphere is an ideal arena in which educated members of society debate. developed by jurgen habermas in the 1990s, it is more a dream than a reality. the museum as the public sphere? question of the public (and counterpublic). is a public sphere just free wifi?</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">communities</h3><div class="prep" concept="3"><p>what kind of communities does the museum serve?</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="3"><ul>
<li><strong>educational</strong> communities (e.g. highschools across the region)</li>
<li><strong>technical</strong> communities (e.g. the neighborhood club on plant-caring)</li>
<li><strong>ethnic</strong> communities (e.g. immigrants, and descendants of immigrants)</li>
<li><strong>socio-economic</strong> communities (e.g. the unemployed, retired, freelancers)</li>
</ul>
</div></div><div class="note-group"><div class="prep note" concept="3">- (geographically) local communities
- school groups
- tourists
- archeologists/artists
- individuals (e.g. students who come on their own)</div></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="3"><p>museums intend to involve communities (plural!), civic engagement, which seems like they would need to fight against <em>individualism</em>; but the individual as narrator, unobscured by gazed-upon communities, giving her own opinion, is also a strong necessity in the development of pluralistic discourses.</p>
<p>the defining traits of belonging to a community are:</p>
<ul>
<li>actions</li>
<li>habits</li>
<li>phrases</li>
<li>worldviews</li>
</ul>
<p>once those traits of communities are identified, they need to be activated through different types of presence:</p>
<ul>
<li>social (recognized by peers)</li>
<li>cognitive (recognized by oneself)</li>
<li>teaching (recognized by a tutor/mentor/teacher)</li>
</ul>
<p>is there a fundamental incompatibility between the singularity of a museum community and the distributedness of a digital network? how can a museum reconciliate these?</p>
</div></div><div class="page-group"><h3 class="page-name">culture</h3><div class="prep" concept="3"><p>museums create <strong>truth</strong>, <strong>heritage</strong> and <strong>culture</strong>, just by virtue of representing it.</p>
<p>&quot;the only purpose of museums is so that people who go to museums can differentiate themselves from people who don&#39;t go to museums&quot; - pierre bourdieu, <em>la distinction</em>.</p>
<p>and yet, because culture is ever changing, museums change with it.</p>
</div><div class="prep" concept="3"></div></div><div class="note-group"></div><div class="writeup-group"><div class="prep writeup" concept="3"><p>museums are, and aren&#39;t political:</p>
<ul>
<li>yes, through their historical, public, nation-building.</li>
<li>no, since they claim to deal with modern art, one which is disembodied, autotelic.</li>
</ul>
<p>one could always distinguish where the museum represents the interests of the powerful (either the state or the elite) or the interests of the public. the issue is that the interest of the public is actually the interest of the publics, and is therefore quite hard to pin down.</p>
